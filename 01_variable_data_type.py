    Variable assignment rule
    1. First of variable name is not number and special character except underscore (_)
    2. First of variable name is not number
    3. Case sensitive (Upper variable name is not same lower variable name: Ex is_male, IS_MALE)
    
    Variable assignment clean code
    1. Python variable is snake case 
    Ex. name, class_name, address
    
    2. Python is high level language. It is not neccessary for assign data type
    
    3. For value of variable name is boolean, assign like question varaible.
    Ex is_male, has_data
    
    4. Variable assignment can be readable.
    Remark: Don't assign short variable except i (index)
    Ex: s = 20, x = 30
